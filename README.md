### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alejandro. I'm a Full-stack engineer, based in Zaragoza (Spain) and currently working for [@hypothesis](https://github.com/hypothesis) as a Senior Frontend Developer.

I love to create and contribute to OSS, and in the past few years I have created [several projects](https://github.com/acelaya?tab=repositories), mostly related with web technologies.

Currently I'm mainly focused on [Shlink](https://shlink.io/), a self-hosted URL shortener.

I also have a blog where I write about software in general, [take a look](https://alejandrocelaya.blog).

You can also follow me in my other social networks:
